#Mario Helps Smurfs

This game created by Fotis Kounelis.

This is a game for 90's cartoon and nintendo lovers. Gargamel attacks in Smurfs and Super Mario needs your help to save the day by winning Azrael.

## Download and Play

You can download this repository in your local machine. To play the game it mostly needs pygame. I recommend an IDE for Python to execute it and run. In case you still need to run it differently, the packages that are needed are pygame, sys, time, random, math, numpy.

### A Word About the Game

It is implemented for recreational purposes. I hope everyone enjoy it and in case you want me to add something more, do not hesitate to conact with me!

This game is more or less a classic game of moving around the screen and shooting the enemies. The bigger the score the more bullets you can shoot simultaneously!

USE ARROW KEYS TO MOVE
USE SPACE TO SHOOT
USE Q TO QUIT

## Getting Started and Ended

To start the game you just run the python file. Your score is 0 in the beggining. The time that the opponents hit you so much and the score goes under 0 you lose. 
As you shoot the enemies you gain points and take levels!

To end the game you can either lose or Kill the boss!
